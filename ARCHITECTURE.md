# Architecture

Written up as it gets built. Stage 1 records only the shape of the repo and the
decisions already made; later stages fill in the pipeline sections.

## Workspaces

An npm workspace root with two packages, `server` and `web`. One `npm install`
at the root installs both. There is no shared package — the two sides exchange
JSON over HTTP and nothing else, so a third workspace for shared types would be
an abstraction with one consumer on each end.

## Server

TypeScript compiled by `tsc` with `module: NodeNext`, so the build output runs
under plain `node dist/index.js` with no loader or bundler. The cost is writing
`.js` on relative imports of `.ts` source files, which is the standard Node ESM
convention. `tsx` runs the same source directly in development with watch mode.

Environment variables are loaded by Node itself via `--env-file-if-exists`, so
there is no dotenv dependency and a missing `.env` is not an error — the
defaults in `config.ts` are enough to run against the mock provider.

`server/src/config.ts` is the only place that reads `process.env`. Everything
else takes its configuration from the exported `config` object, which keeps
tests from having to stub the environment in more than one place.

## Web

React + Vite. The dev server proxies `/api` to `localhost:3001`, so frontend
code calls relative URLs and there is no CORS handling or base-URL config in
the client. The server still enables `cors` for the case where the built bundle
is served from somewhere else.

## Runtime storage

Uploaded originals, rendered page images, exported PDFs and the SQLite file all
live under `server/storage/` and `server/data/`, both gitignored. The uploaded
PDF is stored under a content-addressed name and is never written to again;
export always produces a new file.

## Grading provider

A single `GradeProvider` interface with three implementations behind it — the
real Gemini client and the mock in its several modes. This is the one
abstraction in the codebase that has more than one implementation, which is why
it is the one interface worth having. `GRADE_PROVIDER` selects between them and
defaults to the mock, so the test suite runs with no API key and no network.
